This package contains the source for the jCSRF prototype, plus a simple test application.

To run jCSRF, simply use:
  sudo python proxy.py 8000

Your webserver running on port 80 on your local machine will be
automatically protected.

There are also cmdline options, look at the source. Also CTRL+C and
CTRL+/ can disable CSRF protection and proxy interception.

If you want to change the port used by the proxy, you might have to modify
the iptables script that sets up the interception of packets to port
80.

Your server needs to be configured to force HTTP 1.0 responses,
because some HTTP 1.1 features are not supported by the proxy
(e.g. chunked encoding).

The ipfilter interposition script only works for Linux, but if you can
somehow route the packets through your proxy on another operating
system, I expect the proxy itself will run well on all platforms.

The js file works with Chrome and Firefox. All the features used are
supported by IE as well, but some small adjustments to the code might
be required.
